# LinkBotProgram

Discord invite links and YouTube links will be monitored, and if sent to a banned channel, they will be deleted.

When a prohibited link is sent, a log is sent to the specified channel. Additionally.

you can configure an ON/OFF setting for each channel to determine whether links should be prohibited.

You can also set custom links and monitor any links you like.

You can configure whether to monitor shortened URLs. Examples include (‘bit.ly’, ‘t.co’, ‘tinyurl.com’, ‘is.gd’, ‘buff.ly’)

This program is still incomplete.
I'll update it when I have time!!
