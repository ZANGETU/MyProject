These programs are created using **discord.js v14**.

If you have any questions, please feel free to visit my Discord server.
Whether I answer your questions depends on my mood at the time.

Some projects may require external APIs. :)

These programs have only been verified to work on self-hosted servers. If you plan to deploy them on multiple servers, please verify the programs.
