### **⚠Caution**



`MainWindow.xaml.cs` is the only file published, so it won't run on its own!! You'll get an error.

You must create and add your own XAML file.

Also, if the SDK is not installed on your PC, please install it (version 1.7 or higher recommended).



I will not answer questions about package installation methods or other inquiries; please research them yourself.


### What you need?
* VisualStudio2022
* SDK(Required)
* Windows11(Required)
* It takes motivation.
