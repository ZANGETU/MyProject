# MinecraftPotionEditor

This is a potion creation tool I developed in C# for use in the Java Edition of Minecraft.

I got bored, so I made the source code public.

This program supports DiscordRPC.

If you donâ€™t plan to use it, please remove the relevant parts.

The following packages are used (please download them):

* MetroFramework (required for the program to run)
* DiscordRpc (optional, the program will still run without it)
* You can add a startup sound using "sound\\popopo.wav". If it's not needed, please remove it.

The finished product can be obtained from my website or on Discord.


## Prohibited Actions
* Do not redistribute this program as is (redistribution is allowed if modified).
* Do not claim this program as your own.
* If you use this program, you must include a link to my page.
